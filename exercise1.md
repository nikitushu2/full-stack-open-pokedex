Self-hosted or cloud-based environment?

Self-hosted option for CI is for larger projects. You get your own server and you have a very extensive way of configuring it to your needs. It is greater in flexibility but harder in configurability. Cloud-based option is, on the contrary, for smaller projects. It is easy to configure a project there but you are limited by payment plans that define how much resources you can use. Also, if you need to use graphical card for CI, it would be hard to make that in the cloud.
